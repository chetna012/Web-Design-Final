        <h2>Where would you go?</h2>
        <p>If I could take a vacation, I would go to Hawaii. I love beaches, and Hawaii has one of the best beaches in the world. I would want to visit all the beaches, but if I had to pick, it would be the Kapalua Bay in Maui because of its turquoise waters, which I seem to find so relaxing. I would visit the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park to see the active lava flows.</p>

        <h2>What would you do?</h2>
        <p>My whole trip would be fun because I will get to do all my favorite activities like swimming, travelling, and trying new fruits. I would go hiking on the Diamond Head Trail to click pictures of the sunrise and the sunset. I would also go for whale watching at Makapu’u Lighthouse Trail. I would also enjoy the traditional Hawaiian Luau and have lots of fun with music, dancing, and watching the fire-knife performances.</p>

        <h2>What would you eat?</h2>
        <p>Since I am a vegetarian, I may miss out on some of the most authentic Hawaiian dishes, but I will explore and try the vegetarian foods like the Poi, which is a traditional staple food. I will also have Taro chips for snacking. For dessert, I will try the Haupia and shaved ice with fruity syrups when I go for outdoor activities. I would try the authentic Hawaiian Sweet Potato and the Poi Rolls. I am going to have as many fruits as I can eat because Hawaii has all the fresh fruits like pineapple, mango, Lychee, Lilikoi (Passionfruit), and many more.</p>
